# MNIST_NN
Welcome to the Neural Network from Scratch for MNIST Dataset repository! This project aims to build a neural network entirely from scratch, without relying on any external libraries, to train and test the famous MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

Objective:

The main objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of neural network architectures and the intricacies of training and testing them on real-world datasets. By developing a neural network implementation from scratch, we aim to explore the underlying concepts and techniques involved in building and optimizing deep learning models.

Key Features:

Implementation of a neural network using Python, without the use of external libraries.
Training the neural network on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
Evaluating the trained model's performance on the MNIST test dataset.
Exploration of different neural network architectures and experimentation with various techniques to improve accuracy.

Challenges and Future Plans: None for now, feel fee to give me ideas for the direction of this project

While still in the early stages of development, we anticipate encountering challenges and obstacles along the way. By documenting our journey, we aim to share insights gained from overcoming these challenges and provide a learning resource for others interested in neural network implementations.

In the future, we plan to expand this project by incorporating additional models and techniques, exploring various optimization algorithms, and potentially applying the knowledge gained to other image classification tasks.

Join us on this exciting journey of building a neural network from scratch and unraveling the inner workings of deep learning models!
